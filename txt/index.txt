Welcome!

So I thought I'd try making a plain text website.
And this is it.

There are so many ways to make an awesome website. But it's easy to just dive in and not really pay any attention to what you really have to share and concentrate all your effort on the presentation. Plaintext just might be my ticket out of that hole.

Here's to hoping it can kickstart some ideas and liberate the writing process.

Thanks for stop bying.
